### My Goal is to get you
<Flex>
  <Stack x={100}>
    <Stack y={2}>
      <Box fontSize={100}>üôÑ</Box>
    </Stack>
    <Box>
      From this...
    </Box>
  </Stack>

  <Stack x={100}>
    <Stack y={2}>
      <Box fontSize={100}>ü§î</Box>
    </Stack>
    <Box>
      To this...
    </Box>
  </Stack>

  <Box>
    <Stack y={2}>
      <Box fontSize={100}>üòç</Box>
    </Stack>
    <Box>
      Or even this.
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Flex>

<Notes>My goal is for people to come out of this presentation with a cautiously optimisitic view of CSS-in-JS and to abandon some misconceptions about what it actually is.</Notes>

### Why not just CSS-in-CSS?

<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>Implicit global scope</li>
  <li>Easy to cause unintended consequences</li>
  <li>CSS is primarily a document-based architecture</li>
  <li>Cascading rules can cause problems: !important</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>CSS was developed at a time in the web when we were styling documents, not creating complex web apps in a component-based architecture.
Cascading rules can cause issues.  Lead to nasty things like !important.
</Notes>

### What about BEM, SASS, LESS?

<Notes>
  Technology like SASS and LESS at least give us the ability to modularize and reuse CSS.  Combined with a naming discipline like BEM,
  This can get us past most of the problems of plain old CSS.
  However, there are some drawbacks.
